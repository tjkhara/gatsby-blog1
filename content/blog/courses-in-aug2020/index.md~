Making full use of the lockdown i’m able to devle into topic i’ve been wanting to dive deep into for a long time.

Today finished the linux essentials course by Sander Van Vugt.

Working on the python course by Jose Portilla.

Working on the bash scriptin courses by Jason Cannon also.

The linux knowledge is really helping.
